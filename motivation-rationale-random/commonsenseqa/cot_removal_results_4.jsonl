The answer A (\"literacy\") is the best fit since \"literacy\" implies the ability to read and write, and therefore reading newspaper is a suitable way to practice literacy. Answer B (\"knowing how to read\") suggests that people don't know how to read before they start reading newspapers, which is not likely true. Answer C (\"money\") suggests that people can learn about money by reading newspapers, but this may not be an important reason why people choose to read newspaper.
