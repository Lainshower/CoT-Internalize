So there are at least 2 people - say one with salary 0 and the other with 100k. No salary will be outside this range. Median = 50k more than lowest. So median is right in the center of lowest and highest since lowest and highest differ by 100k. In our example, median = 50k.

Mean = 20k more than median so in our example, mean salary = 70k on the number line, 0......50k (median)......100k mean = 70k so there must be people more toward 100k to bring the mean up to 70k.
